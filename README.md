# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

To review and analyize a data set of various kickstarter campaigns to make descisions on future campaigns

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Below is a line graph comparing launch date (by month) of the included theatre campaigns

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

The main challenge was deciding what to do with errors in precentages, however this was over all fixed by simply setting them as 0. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
  Spring and Summer (May to August) are the best times to launch a theatre kickstarter, with May being the best month
  
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

  Lower goals for kickstarters are more likely to succeed, while higher ones are more likely to fail.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
  Marketing of the kickstarters is not included, so we can only base our understanding on things like launch date, and kickstarter goals. Which makes it impossible to figure out the outliers to the oberserved trends.
  For example, there were some successful kickstarters with large goals, did marketing play a role in getting these successes despite the trend saying they shouldn't? 


- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
  We could compare average pledged amount in successful kickstarter vs failed when compared to their goals, and see if there is any trends there that we can use to our advatange.
